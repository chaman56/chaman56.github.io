# Exploring Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling fast and efficient.

Instead of writing custom CSS like `.my-button { background-color: blue; padding: 1rem; }`, you use utility classes directly in your HTML:












`<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">Click Me</button>`

It takes some getting used to, but it's very powerful for rapid development.
